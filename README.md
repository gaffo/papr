# Gaffo PAPR

PAPR is a *P*owered *A*ir-*P*urifying *R*espirator. It is a hood with a supply that blows filtered air to a worker in a dirty environment. It is much less tiring to wear than masks or other methods.

This is my open documenation on research I have done into a PAPR device which can be hopefully used by others. All of this work is open source. Working on the licensing.
